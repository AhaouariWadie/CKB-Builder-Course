## Challenges & Notes
- Some syntax differences between JavaScript and Java required careful attention.
- Practicing with the FreeCodeCamp interactive editor was helpful for immediate feedback.
- Understanding loop control and nesting logic required multiple attempts for clarity.

## Goals for Next Week

- Study ES6 syntax, arrow functions, and classes.
- Start experimenting with JavaScript in a browser-based environment or Replit.
