## Summary of Activities

### Thursday, 26 June 2025
- Began syncing a CKB devnet node following Nervos docs.
- Used the command `./ckb-cli rpc sync_state` to check synchronization.
- Observed `IBD: true`, indicating the node is in Initial Block Download mode.

### Friday, 27 June 2025
- Monitored block synchronization progress via repeated `sync_state` checks.
- Noted changes in `best_known_block_number`, confirming ongoing sync.
- Reviewed Nervos node discovery settings in `ckb.toml`.

### Saturday, 28 June 2025
- Forked Java example project at [ckb-example on Replit](https://replit.com/@fjchen7/ckb-example).
- Inspected `Main.java`, which initializes a transaction with:
  ```java
  ECKeyPair keyPair = ECKeyPair.create("0x...");
  Address address = Address.fromKey(keyPair, Network.TESTNET);
  ```
- Studied how Java SDK structures raw transactions.

### Sunday, 29 June 2025
- Switched focus to Ubuntu environment for tool setup.
- Extracted source archive using: `tar -xzvf git-2.50.0.tar.gz`.
- Identified missing build tools (`gcc`, `make`) and searched for Git binaries.
- Located Git portable builds via: `https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/`.

### Monday, 30 June 2025
- Ran devnet status checks using:
  ```bash
  ./ckb rpc get_peers
  ./ckb-cli rpc sync_state
  ```
- Explored peer connectivity and how block data is downloaded.
- Evaluated node's role in the probe map by editing `ckb.toml`.

### Tuesday, 01 July 2025
- Shared CKB wallet addresses for payment and faucet testing.
- Example testnet address: `ckt1qzda0cr08m85hc8jlnfp3zer7xulejywt49...`
- Used the following command to check testnet balance:
  ```bash
  ./ckb-cli wallet get-capacity --address <testnet-address>
  ```

### Wednesday, 02 July 2025
- Continued explaining Java transaction code line by line.
- Compared CLI-based and SDK-based transaction flows.
- Began writing documentation to clarify logic of each block in `Main.java`.

## Challenges & Notes
- Node syncing was slow due to IBD but proceeded steadily.
- Java SDK documentation required cross-referencing with Replit example.
- Git installation on Ubuntu faced missing dependencies, resolved via portable binary.

## Goals for Next Week
- Finalize Java-based transaction and test it on devnet.
- Document Java code and commands used in detail.
- Transition from Java to Rust SDK tools.
- Deploy and interact with a custom script cell.
